# style_transfer
neural style transfer using VGG19 pertained network and laplacian pyramid normalization

results were obtained on Nvidia_Geforce-1080Ti with 1000 iterations and less in some cases.
L-BFGS-B optimizaer in scipy was used.

>To use the VGG networks, the npy files for [VGG19 NPY](https://mega.nz/#!xZ8glS6J!MAnE91ND_WyfZ_8mvkuSa2YcA7q-1ehfSm-Q1fxOvvs) has to be downloaded, and placed in the directory of the code.

>the input images can be of any shape but must be "rgb" format.
